# Three.js Experiment
Here you'll find my play around with in browser 3D library three.js
This library utilises webGL, making it a lot more accessable.

Have a look at what I've got going [here](https://patlim.github.io/threejs-experiment/)
There's plenty more shapes and styles I have got in the index.html, just commmented out.

I am looking to create a react app where the user can select these different styles.
