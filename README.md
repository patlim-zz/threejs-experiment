# Three.js Experiment
Here you'll find my play around with in browser 3D library three.js
This library utilises webGL, making it a lot more accessable.

Have a look at my [demo!](https://patlim.github.io/threejs-experiment/)
The comments throughout the html file are from a lightning talk demonstration I did at Enspiral.

I am looking to create a react app where the user can select these different styles.
